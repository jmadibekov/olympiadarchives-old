        Hello, my name is Nurbakyt. </br> </br> 

        Because we're lack of a platform where anyone could have an access to archives of past Kazakhstani Olympiads (or at least we had a website "olympiads.kz", which is now outdated), it caused a big problem for anyone who wanted prepare using past problems. As a person who committed quite enough time to competitive programming, I know that most of prospective students preparing to National/International Olympiads tend to use past archives. Because of it this website was created. 

        </br> </br>

        If you want to contact me regarding anything in this website, just email me. :)

        </br> </br>

        If you was interested to see my experience in competitive programming, though I am not quite the experienced one, you can check my accounts in different CP websites.
